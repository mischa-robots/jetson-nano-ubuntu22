# Jetson Nano — Ubuntu 22.04 Server Image

A ready-to-run Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy) server image for the Jetson Nano with CUDA, TensorRT, OpenCV, Python 3.10.12 and automatic fan control pre-installed.

This image is based on NVIDIA JetPack 4.6.6 / L4T R32.7.6 and upgrades the userspace to Ubuntu 22.04.

⚠️ Private Beta — This image is currently in private beta testing. The public download link will be published once everything is verified and working. If you'd like to help test, feel free to send me a DM or open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/mischa-robots/jetson-nano-ubuntu22/issues).

## NOT Included

* Desktop environment (maybe in future as separate image)
* Docker (maybe in future as separate image)
* Vulkan drivers are not supported on the Jetson Nano.

---

## Requirements

* Jetson Nano (4GB or 2GB)
* SD card — **64GB recommended**, 16GB minimum
* Monitor + keyboard **or** ethernet connection for headless setup via SSH
* optional: USB Stick for swapfile and other high IO files (reduces sd card wear).

---

## 1. Flash the SD Card

### With Balena Etcher (recommended)

Download [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io), select `jetson-nano-ubuntu22-server.img.xz` and flash to your SD card. Etcher handles decompression automatically.

### With dd

```bash
xz -dc jetson-nano-ubuntu22-server.img.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
sync
```

> ⚠️ Replace `/dev/sdX` with your actual SD card device. Double check with `lsblk` — writing to the wrong device will destroy your data.

---

## 2. First Boot

Insert the SD card into your Jetson Nano and power it on.

On first boot the partition will **automatically expand** to fill your SD card — this takes about 30 seconds. The board will then be ready to use.

Login credentials:

| User     | Password |
| -------- | -------- |
| `jetson` | `jetson` |

> 🔒 Change your password after first login with `passwd`

---

## 3. Connect to Network

### Ethernet

Just plug in a cable, it connects automatically.

### WiFi

```bash
# list available networks
nmcli device wifi list

# connect to your network (will prompt for password)
sudo nmcli device wifi connect "YourSSID" --ask
```

### Headless via SSH

```bash
ssh jetson@nano1.local
```

Or use the IP address shown on the monitor.

---

## 4. Verify System

```bash
# Jetson system monitor (CPU, GPU, RAM, temperature, fan)
sudo jtop

# Fan control service status
sudo systemctl status jetfanc

# Check CUDA
nvcc --version

# Run full SDK validation
sudo ~/test-sdk.sh
```

> Note: if `nvcc` is not found interactively, add CUDA to your PATH permanently:
> ```bash
> sudo tee /etc/profile.d/cuda.sh >/dev/null <<'EOF'
> export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}
> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}
> EOF
> source /etc/profile.d/cuda.sh
> ```

## Known Limitations

* CUDA 10.2 only — newer CUDA versions are not supported on Jetson Nano
* OpenCV 4.5.4 is CPU only for now — a CUDA-enabled build is in progress
* JetPack 4.6.6 base — some newer libraries targeting JetPack 5.x will not be compatible
* Python bindings for TensorRT and VPI are not functional — C++ APIs work correctly
* No desktop environment — this is a server image
* Docker not included - work in progress

---

## Tested On

* Jetson Nano 4GB (B01)
